      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="parent">
        <p>I've always been fascinated with the notion that there's so much about our world that we don't yet understand. When I entered college I realized that conducting research allowed me to turn that passion into a career. I love the idea of
          using
          science to leave a subject area better than I found it,
          and I look forward to trying to do that to the best of my ability for the rest of my life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At the moment I'm researching interconnection techniques for low-gain avalanche diodes at Brookhaven Naitonal Lab as an intern. I'll be continuining this research in Summer 2021. I'll be presenting this research at SURC 2021. I'm also preparing a manuscript for submission to AMIA's 2022 informatics conference, based on a program I wrote to enable a doctoral psychology lab at Adelphi University to conduct judgement of contingency expereiments remotely.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I love animals, playing games in my spare time (I'm big into MMO's like World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14), cooking, and running with my local running club. I'm also rereading Game of Thrones for the fortieth time.</p>
