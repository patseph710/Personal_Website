    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="parent">
      <p>I've always been fascinated with the notion that there's so much about our world that we don't yet understand. When I entered college I realized that conducting research allowed me to turn that passion into a career. I love the idea of using science to leave a subject area better than I found it,
      and I look forward to trying to do that to the best of my ability for the rest of my life.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I love animals, playing games in my spare time (I'm big into MMO's like World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14) and running with my local running club.</p>
